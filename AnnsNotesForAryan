overall you are doing well Aryan but there are some fundamental things you need to work on.
I've included notes about most of your programs. For some of them I want you to incorporate my notes
and create another version of the program incorporating the feedback. If you have questions - PLEASE ASK!!!!



12by12 - rather than using a single for loop, look at using nested for loops.
            Let the computer do the work for you, rather than you doing it
            by adding a really long print statement. There are examples in the book.
            search - nested for loop
ch10_1

DEBUG

DRUNKpirate - rather than having so many duplicate statements with different arguments, look at
            creating a list then loop on that list with just two moves in the body of the loop.

Encapsulate

EvenNum - your function should have a parameter. When you call your function, the argument should
            be the list that you created before the call. Give that list a different name outside
             of your function. Also, you have created a function which
            does a print - a chatterbox function. Remove the print from the function, add a return,
            then do your print in the main part of your program.

            *** I want to see your new version of the this program.***

Exercise_13 - in these chapter 8 problems you are not following directions. You were supposed to include
            a test suite. The book specified several test cases. Also, you used a method we haven't learned yet in the book. That's fine that
            you found a suitable method, but you also need to create your own version of the program that
            uses just what we have learned and show that it works.

            ***Please redo and let me know when it's corrected.
            Don't delete this program, just create a new file called Exercise_13_ver2 and then let me know when
            it's complete.

HowManyOddNum - same note as in EvenNum.   Please add a _ver2  and let me know when it's done.

LastExercise - your program doesn't work. Be sure you go through the solution and debug your program.

Mirror - add a test suite. please follow the directions in the exercises....

MOdify - if list = "OJQSPM", your program wouldn't work. Think about how you could modify it so it would
   work no matter the order of the also - need to encapsulate this.
   same note as EvenNum - no Chatterbox functions!! redo _ver2

NegativeNumbers - same note as EvenNum - redo _ver2.  Also - was this program supposed to be counting the negative numbers
                or summing the negative numbers?

NumDigits - where is your test suite?????? redo - _ver2

NumEvenDigits - test suite

Palindrome - test suite

ParagraphTjing - look over the solution to this and make sure you understand it.  Then create _ver2
                    of your program, incorporating changes from the solution.

Problem1_ch9 - your solution is incorrect. Look over the solution and make sure you understand it.
               look up the definition of a tuple in your  book. make sure you understand how to
               create a tuple. Ask questions if needed.....

RemoveLetter - you're using a method we haven't covered yet.... show solution without that method.   Also
                your second for loop has an error. Think about how you would solve this problem without
                programming. You would ask is the letter I am checking for in the word, not is the part of the
                word I am checking in the letter.....


Shapes  - are you working through this? would love to see it when you get it running...

SubString - you are using methods not in the book. please redo _ver2

SumOfsquares - your variable names need to make sense. You aren't actually counting anything in this program.
            rename count to something that makes sense.

Words5 - chatterbox function. Also, change the name of your list to something different from the function's parameter.

WordsBackwards - notice that you are printing None. Fix that. Also - you have created a chatterbox function here. c
            correct in _ver2
